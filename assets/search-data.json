[{"id":"1","title":"Rationale","content":"Rationale\nnix-mineral tries to address as many system level risks as possible, but there are some things which could improve security but are not feasible to implement.\nThis is most apparent when there are \"switches\" which can't necessarily be turned \"on\" and \"off,\" or when setup can't be declarative.\nUseful resources which could improve security, but can't be directly implemented in nix-mineral are listed here for individual reference.\nResources\nhttps://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Encrypted_DNS\nhttps://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-proxy\nEncrypted DNS. It's not that important, but you might as well. Not included due to significant disagreement on what the ideal DNS server to choose is. Encrypted DNS is easily rendered useless due to adjacent information leaks. This is at no fault to encrypted DNS itself; it's encrypted just fine, but there's simply too many other ways to see or otherwise interfere with a user's browsing regardless. Notable implementations are in systemd-resolved and dnscrypt-proxy.\nhttps://github.com/infinisil/sanix\nhttps://grahamc.com/blog/erase-your-darlings/\nhttps://elis.nu/blog/2020/05/nixos-tmpfs-as-root/\nhttps://github.com/nix-community/impermanence\nStatelessness, through whatever implementation, may result in malware being cleared on reboot. Not included, since it's easy to bypass if known about, and most solutions are highly dependent on other components of the user's configuration (requiring btrfs, zfs, high amounts of ram, and differing opinions on what to persist and what not to). There are many more implementations than listed.\nhttps://github.com/nix-community/lanzaboote\nSecure boot on NixOS, which is a highly impactful mitigation of \"evil maid\" attacks. Can't be set declaratively, although it's planned to mainlined at some point; when this happens, this will be integrated into nix-mineral.\nhttps://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/security-privacy-advice.html\nBasic OPSEC. Decent, concise advice. Many will disagree with, or just disregard a lot here, but the \"General\" advice here is applicable and useful to most people.\nhttps://github.com/arkenfox/user.js\nhttps://github.com/dwarfmaster/arkenfox-nixos\nMost desktop NixOS users use Firefox. Locking it down a bit is commonsense.\nhttps://codeberg.org/celenity/Phoenix\nAn arkenfox alternative featuring a NixOS module. This may make you stand out due to a smaller userbase, though.\nhttps://github.com/ryantm/agenix\nhttps://github.com/Mic92/sops-nix\nSecrets management lets you more safely declaratively set password on NixOS, along with managing other sensitive info. Not included by default because people have different passwords (obviously) and if you imperatively set your password, you don't have to worry about this. There are many, many more implementations than listed.\nhttps://github.com/nixpak/nixpak\nhttps://github.com/Naxdy/nix-bwrapper\nBubblewrap is arguably the best sandboxing solution for desktop Linux. There's many projects to make using bubblewrap easier to use for nix, and these are just some examples. Convenient hardening is better than no hardening, though for fine grained control power users can manually sandbox their stuff or use something else.\nhttps://github.com/e-tho/ucodenix\namd-ucode mainly targets server CPUs, NOT consumer CPUs. If your OEM no longer provides updates for your AMD systemz microcode will likely never be updated by a standard Linux hardware. Luckily, someone made a tool to do so automatically. Certain outdated firmware may prevent updating of microcode past a certain point, see the repo linked above for more details.\nRust replacements, for example:\nhttps://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/sudo-rs\nhttps://github.com/pendulum-project/ntpd-rs\nAll other rust replacements for common Linux services and applications fall under this catagory unless they do something \"novel.\" You need to ask yourself whether guaranteed memory safety is worth the risk of a less audited, and sometimes larger codebase. Do you trust the programming language architecture or the programmer more?\nhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8915/\nConsider using NTP implementations that support NTS, so that NTP requests are encrypted and prevent tampering or eavesdropping which may interfere with certain authentication mechanism. nix-mineral.extras.system.secure-chrony does this, but is highly opinionated in configuration. There are many other implementations not listed here.\nhttps://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Automatic_system_upgrades\nRegular updates keep your system patched from many known vulnerabilities. Not included by default because most people will schedule their auto-updates differently (or object to automatic updates entirely for a variety of non-security related reasons, e.g avoiding unwanted feature changes).\nhttps://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Chromium\nor NIXOS_OZONE_WL=1\nTangentially related. For some reason, Chromium doesn't use Wayland by default on NixOS. This means no window isolation, and it comes with the added effect that Chromium is a blurry mess if you use display scaling.\nhttps://github.com/lkrg-org/lkrg\nSupposedly kills several classes of vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel.

It contains all lib functions, builtins, and additional nix-mineral functions.\nFormat the code with the formatter in flake.nix. If using NixOS, use the nix fmt command within the repository, which will format all files with the correct formatter.\nExplain the options in their descriptions (or in comments). The reason for each setting, and WHY this setting makes the system more secure for the user.\nWhen creating new settings, use names in lowercase and hyphens to separate words, for example: example-feature-x.\nInvert options that are intended to disable something, for example: don't use disable-example-feature-y, use example-feature-y and set the default to false.\nUse the l.mkBoolOption function to create boolean options.\nDo not attempt to add any feature which has been intentionally excluded under OMITTED.md or ADDITIONAL-RESOURCES.md without first creating an issue.\nIssues should be created for most feature changes before attempting a PR. Bug fixes, and minor documentation changes do not require issues, but it is still heavily encouraged.\nWhere applicable, update both presets and the README to reflect any new options.\nUse l.mkOverride 900 over l.mkForce when forcefully overriding NixOS defaults is necessary, to make sure it actually applies.\nWhere applicable, add GPL license headers to new source code files:\n\nLibs\nnix-mineral has a library with things used in several files in the project, to avoid code repetition. Common things you'll likely use are explained here. Each function declaration and detailed explanations are located in the lib/default.nix file. l is an attrset with all the lib functions, builtins functions, and nix-mineral functions. So use l to access any function below.\nl.mkBoolOption: Creates a boolean option with description and default value.\nTakes 2 arguments: desc, bool\nExample:\nl.sources: Attrset with all sources inside the lib/sources.toml file (Used with fetchGhFile, fetchGit, fetchTarball, etc).\nl.fetchGhFile: Fetches a file directly from a GitHub repository.\nArgs:\nuser: GitHub username or organization name.\nrepo: Repository name.\nrev: Branch, tag or commit.\nfile: Path to the file within the repository.\nsha256: Hash sha256 of the file.\n\nExamples:\nUsing with l.sources:\nl.importModule: import wrapper to pass extra args to a module, and also pass the lib l.\nTakes 2 arguments: path, extraArgs\nExample:\nCreating a module\nChoose a module type: settings: Main settings, which modify things in the default preset. extras: Extra settings, which modify things only if specified by the user, and may contain opinionated additional software.\nChoose a category: Enter the folder for your chosen module type, and choose a category to place your module in (or create a new one if needed).\nCreate the module file: Let's say I want to create a settings module in the system category. Here's what the process would look like:\n\nFirst, I create a file example-module.nix inside the system folder with this:\nImport the module: Inside the system folder, there is a file with the name default.nix, which imports all modules within that category. You just need to add the relative file path to the categoryModules list inside the settings/system/default.nix file.\nExamples of different modules: settings/system/multilib.nix: A simple module. settings/kernel/cpu-mitigations.nix: A module that uses an enum instead of a bool. extras/misc/usbguard.nix: A module with several options.\n\nCreating a category\nChoose a module type: settings: Main settings, which modify things in the default preset. extras: Extra settings, which modify things only if specified by the user, and may contain opinionated additional software.\nCreate a folder with the category name within the chosen module type: Example: settings/new-category\nCreate a default.nix file inside the category folder: Example: settings/new-category/default.nix Place the following code inside the file, adapting the name, description, and the modules you want to add:\n\nImport the category: Within the nix-mineral.nix file, import the category by adding the relative path of the category folder to the settingsModules or extrasModules list, depending on the type of category you created. Example: settings/new-category would be imported within the settingsModules list in the nix-mineral.nix file.\n\nHardening a filesystem\nTo harden a filesystem, you follow the same options a normal user would use, but simply place these options inside the filesystems/normal.nix or filesystems/special.nix modules, depending on the type of filesystem you want to harden. Examples are within the files.\nCreating a preset\nCreate a file with the preset name inside the presets folder: Example: presets/example-preset.nix The code inside the file is the same as what a normal user would use to configure nix-mineral, but each option must be set using mkPreset or mkPresets functions. mkPreset is used to set a single option, while mkPresets is used to set multiple options within an attrset. An example of a preset below:\n\nAdd your preset to the presets/default.nix file: In the presets attrset at the top of the file, add your preset with the name as the key and the description as the value. Your preset name must match the filename you created in step 1. This will automatically import the preset file when the user includes the preset name in their configuration.\n\nAdding functions to the lib\nCreate your function within the let in in the lib/default.nix file, following the pattern of the other functions. Then place your function within the flake.lib list at the end of the file, and within the list inside the importModule function as well.\nLicensing and copyright\nBecause it is pragmatic to take from existing research, consideration to licensing applies.\nThis is not legal advice.

performance.\nDisabling implicitly disables reuse of TIME_WAIT sockets, as they depend on TCP timestamps which may lead to corruption and an inability to detect duplicate packets. It may also result in port exhaustion as ports may not be immediately reused.\nThere are possible information leaks when timestamps are enabled. Offset randomization used by default prevents uptime prediction, but the rate of incrementing timestamps can be used in some advanced attacks to predict the current clock speed of a running system.\nBecause nix-mineral has different priorities to Whonix, which influences Kicksecure's development, we choose not to disable timestamps by default since clock speed fingerprinting is not a
